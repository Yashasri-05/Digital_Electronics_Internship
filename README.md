# What is digital electronics?
Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with systems that use discrete (distinct) signal levels, typically represented by binary numbers — 0 and 1. Unlike analog electronics, where signals can vary smoothly across a range of values, digital electronics processes information using only two states (usually referred to as LOW and HIGH, or OFF and ON).

These two states are typically represented by:

0 → low voltage (e.g., 0 volts)

1 → high voltage (e.g., 5 volts or 3.3 volts)

# Digital VS Analog

# Analog                                                                             

1.Continuous signals                                                               

2.Can represent infinite possible values within a range 

3.More susceptible to noise and degradation

4.Examples: vinyl records, analog clocks, FM/AM radio  

# Digital

1.Discrete signals

2.Represents information in binary (0s and 1s) |

3.More resistant to noise and interference

4.Examples: CDs, digital clocks, streaming audio |
