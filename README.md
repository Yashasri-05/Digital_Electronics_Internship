# What is digital electronics?
Digital electronics is a branch of electronics that deals with systems that use discrete (distinct) signal levels, typically represented by binary numbers — 0 and 1. Unlike analog electronics, where signals can vary smoothly across a range of values, digital electronics processes information using only two states (usually referred to as LOW and HIGH, or OFF and ON).

These two states are typically represented by:

0 → low voltage (e.g., 0 volts)

1 → high voltage (e.g., 5 volts or 3.3 volts)

# Digital VS Analog signals
|  ASPECT | DIGITAL SIGNAL | ANALOG SIGNAL|
|----------|----------|----------|
| Nature | Discrete   | Continuous
| Signal Representation |  Square waves | Sine waves (or continuous waveforms)|
|  Values| Finite set of values (typically 2: 0 and 1) | Infinite possible values within range|
| Transmission | Difficult over long distances | Easy and accurate over long distances   |
|Devices| Computers, digital watches, microcontrollers | Microphones, speakers, analog radios | | Data Processing | Easier and more precise | More complex and less precise |            
| Examples | Computer data, digital telephony  | Audio signals, temperature sensors |
# LOGIC LEVELS
In digital electronics, logic levels refer to the specific voltage ranges that represent binary states — typically 0 (LOW) and 1 (HIGH). These levels indicate how the digital system interprets voltages as logical TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).
| Logic Level | Binary State | Typical Voltage (TTL)* | Typical Voltage (CMOS)* |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| LOW         | 0            | 0 V to 0.8 V           | 0 V to ~1/3 Vdd         |
| HIGH        | 1            | 2 V to 5 V             | ~2/3 Vdd to Vdd         |
* TTL = Transistor-Transistor Logic (usually Vcc = 5V)
* CMOS = Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor
# NUMBER SYSTEM
A number system is a way to represent and express numbers using a set of symbols or digits. In digital electronics, number systems are used to represent data and perform calculations inside digital circuits and computers.

# Different number systems are BINARY, OCTAL,DECIMAL, HEXADECIMAL
| Number System | Base | Digits Used              | Key Point | Example |
|---------------|------|--------------------------|-----------|---------|
| Binary        | 2    | 0, 1                     | Fundamental for all digital circuits and computers; data is processed in bits (0s & 1s). | 1011₂ ( = 11 in decimal ) |
| Octal         | 8    | 0-7                      | Compact representation of binary; often used in older computer systems and some embedded systems. | 745₈ ( = 493 in decimal ) |
| Decimal       | 10   | 0-9                      | Natural number system used by humans; common for input/output display. | 259₁₀ |
| Hexadecimal   | 16   | 0-9, A-F (A=10 ... F=15) | Compact representation of binary; widely used in programming, memory addressing. | 3F₁₆ ( = 63 in decimal ) |
